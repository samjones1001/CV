Iâ€™m an ambitious and conscientious **Full Stack Junior Developer**, seeking a London-based role where I can consolidate and extend my existing knowledge.

Following time spent living in Japan and a stint working for a charity, where I was able to develop strong project management, communication and organisational skills, I have spent the past five years in the education sector, qualifying as a key stage 1 and 2 primary teacher in 2014. It was in this role that I became interested in code. Initially to support my students in their first steps in programming, and then as an enthusiastic amateur coder myself.

I have spent the past three months at Makers Academy, an intensive 12 week software development bootcamp, which has allowed me to grow into confident junior developer.  The experience has fed my passion for writing clean, reusable and rigorously tested code, and engrained in me the importance of following coding best practices.  I am now looking to work in an environment where I can continue building upon what I have learned.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator
In my previous role as a primary teacher, it was necessary for me to explain challenging concepts to learners.  It was vital to be creative and flexible in my approach, as it was often necessary to illustrate the same concept in a variety of ways to suit varied learning needs.  My lessons were consistently rated as good or outstanding by both internal and external observers, and I was frequently complimented on the clarity of my explanation.  

I further recognise the importance of clear, concise written communication having had my writing published in AGI Magazine and elsewhere.  I was also the first point of contact for partners and clients during my time working for a charity, which taught me about relationship building and the importance of timely, open communication.  More recently, I have kept my writing skills sharp by [blogging](https://medium.com/@sam.jones494) about my experiences at Makers Academy.

#### Quick learner
As a student I spent a year living and studying at a university in Tokyo.  On arriving in the country I spoke barely a word of Japanese and had zero reading or writing ability. Over time, I was able to pick up the language at an accelerated pace, quickly becoming conversationally proficient and able to read and write to a good standard.  By the end of the year, I had advanced sufficiently to be able to deliver a five minute presentation on intercultural communication to an audience of around 200 native speakers.  

As a student at Makers Academy, I underwent a similarly accelerated learning process, gaining a good working understanding of a range of languages and frameworks. 

#### Inquisitive
Whether undergoing twelve weeks of intensive study at Makers Academy, travelling to a new country or trying out a new musical instrument, I have always loved learning of any kind.  This passion for aquiring and sharing knowledge is what initially attracted me to teaching and, when it was introduced onto the national curriculum, to start exploring coding for the first time.  I  constantly strive to expand the horizons of my knowledge and ability, and love wrestling with complex new problems.

I am registered as a coach with [codebar](https://codebar.io), a not for profit organisation which organises regular workshops for beginner coders - both to consolidate my own understanding of what I have learned, and to share my knowledge with others.

#### Adaptable
As a teacher in a primary school, it was important for me to be flexible and adaptable in my work.  I needed to respond to situations as they arose, whether by covering someone elses class, or altering lesson plans on the fly based on learner's needs or misconceptions. 

Furthermore, during the Makers Academy course I spent every day pairing with other students.  I pride myself on my capacity for collaborating with others and adapting to their preferred working methods. This ability led to the formation of strong working relationships with all other members of the cohort.

#### Motivated
I completed the Makers Academy curriculum as part of a remote cohort, communicating with coaches and fellow students through video conferencing software.  Completing the course in this way required significant discipline and focus.  Prior to enrolling on the course I had also engaged in self directed study of coding around the long hours demanded by a career in teaching.

#### Additional skills
Methodologies : Agile, XP, Test Driven Development
Foreign languages : Intermediate spoke and written Japanese

## Interests

**Musician:**
I've played guitar in various bands since the tender age of 14.  Although my plans to make millions from punk rock haven't panned out (yet), I did once play on the same bill as turn of the millenium garage  sensation Ms Dynamite.

**Traveller:**
Exploring the world and experiencing other cultures is my passion and I'm constantly planning my next adventure.
