Ambitious and conscientious Full Stack Junior Developer, seeking a London-based role where I can consolidate and extend my existing knowledge.

Having graduated from Makers Academy - a highly-selective, intense 12-week software development bootcamp - earlier in the year, I am currently employed in my first development position at HSBC.  I’m passionate about continuing to improve upon the skills I’ve developed in this role and and at Makers; writing clean, reusable and rigorously tested code, getting hands on experience with new technologies, and building awesome things. I’m looking for my next position in an environment where I can keep working on genuine, challenging problems and ramp my learning up to the next level.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator
In my previous role as a primary teacher, it was necessary for me to explain challenging concepts to learners.  It was vital to be creative and flexible in my approach, as it was often necessary to illustrate the same concept in a variety of ways to suit varied learning needs.  My lessons were consistently rated as good or outstanding by both internal and external observers, and I was frequently complimented on the clarity of my explanation.  

I also recognise the importance of clear, concise written communication having had my writing published in AGI Magazine and elsewhere.  I was also the first point of contact for partners and clients during my time working for a charity, which taught me about relationship building and the importance of timely, open communication.  More recently, I have kept my writing skills sharp by [blogging](https://medium.com/@sam.jones494) about my experiences at Makers Academy.

#### Quick learner
As a student I spent a year living and studying at a university in Tokyo.  On arriving in the country I spoke barely a word of Japanese and had zero reading or writing ability. Over time, I was able to pick up the language at an accelerated pace, quickly becoming conversationally proficient and able to read and write to a good standard.  By the end of the year, I had advanced sufficiently to be able to deliver a five minute presentation on intercultural communication to an audience of around 200 native speakers.  

As a student at Makers Academy, I underwent a similarly accelerated learning process, gaining a good working understanding of a range of languages and frameworks. 

#### Inquisitive
I have always loved learning of any kind.  This passion for acquiring and sharing knowledge is what initially attracted me to teaching and, when it was introduced onto the national curriculum, to start exploring coding for the first time.  I  constantly strive to expand the horizons of my knowledge and ability, and love wrestling with complex new problems.

I am registered as a coach with [codebar](https://codebar.io), a not for profit organisation which organises regular workshops for beginner coders - both to consolidate my own understanding of what I have learned, and to share my knowledge with others.

#### Adaptable
As a teacher in a primary school, it was important for me to be flexible and adaptable in my work.  I needed to respond to situations as they arose, whether by covering someone elses class, or altering lesson plans on the fly based on learner's needs or misconceptions. 

Furthermore, during the Makers Academy course I spent every day pairing with other students.  I pride myself on my capacity for collaborating with others and adapting to their preferred working methods. This ability led to the formation of strong working relationships with all other members of the cohort.

#### Motivated
I completed the Makers Academy curriculum as part of a remote cohort, communicating with coaches and fellow students through video conferencing software.  Completing the course in this way required significant discipline and focus.  Prior to enrolling on the course I had also engaged in self directed study of coding around the long hours demanded by a career in teaching.

#### Additional skills
Methodologies : Agile, XP, Test Driven Development
Foreign languages : Intermediate spoke and written Japanese

I've played guitar in various bands since the tender age of 14.  Although my plans to make millions from punk rock haven't panned out (yet), I did once play on the same bill as turn of the millennium garage  sensation Ms Dynamite.

Exploring the world and experiencing other cultures is my passion and I'm constantly planning my next adventure.
